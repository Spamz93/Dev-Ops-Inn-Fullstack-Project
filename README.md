**Setup Instructions**

_Backend Setup_

1.Navigate to the backend folder:
cd backend

npm install
Run the backend server (it runs on port 5000 by default):

3.npm run dev
Verify the API by visiting http://localhost:5000/api/rooms.


_Frontend Setup_

1.Open a new terminal, navigate to the frontend folder:
cd frontend

2.Install dependencies:
npm install

3.Run the frontend development server (by default on port 5173):
npm run dev

4.Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

_API Endpoints_
